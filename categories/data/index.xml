      <description>It has been about 4 months since I started working at Branch and wanted to reflect on what it&amp;rsquo;s been like.
I can truly say that I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying everything about it. The environment is fantastic, my co-workers are awesome, and we all come from various backgrounds.
I like the fact that the company takes their values seriously and the founding team is focused on making working at Branch the best experience you&amp;rsquo;ve ever had in your career.</description>
