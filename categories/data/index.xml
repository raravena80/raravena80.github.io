      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been about 4 months since I started working at &lt;a href=&#34;https://branch.io&#34;&gt;Branch&lt;/a&gt; and wanted&#xA;to reflect on what it&amp;rsquo;s been like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can truly say that I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying everything about it. The environment is&#xA;fantastic, my co-workers are awesome, and we all come from various backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like the fact that the company takes their values seriously and the founding team is&#xA;focused on making working at Branch the best experience you&amp;rsquo;ve ever had&#xA;in your career. There&amp;rsquo;s also a very strong focus on diversity as the&#xA;founding team puts it: The more diverse we are, the better we will&#xA;be positioned in the long run. Being more diverse allow us to bring in&#xA;different points of view and experiences that in the end help us&#xA;progress more efficiently. I can&amp;rsquo;t say that there are many places like that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
