to reflect on what it&amp;rsquo;s been like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can truly say that I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying everything about it. The environment is
fantastic, my co-workers are awesome, and we all come from various backgrounds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like the fact that the company takes their values seriously and the founding team is
focused on making working at Branch the best experience you&amp;rsquo;ve ever had
in your career. There&amp;rsquo;s also a very strong focus on diversity as the
founding team puts it: The more diverse we are, the better we will
be positioned in the long run. Being more diverse allow us to bring in
different points of view and experiences that in the end help us
progress more efficiently. I can&amp;rsquo;t say that there are many places like that.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
