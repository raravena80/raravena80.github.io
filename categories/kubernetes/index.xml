      <description>Over the past six months, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation&amp;rsquo;s (CNCF) Cloud Native AI (CNAI) Working Group has been at the forefront of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with cloud-native technologies. This is a moment to discuss the working group&amp;rsquo;s initiatives and opportunities for contributors and enthusiasts as we prepare for KubeCon Europe 2025 in London.&#xA;The group has been making strides in galvanizing the community around the needs of AI/ML workloads on top of cloud native environments.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone! I&amp;rsquo;m excited to write this post about my experience at the Kubernetes Forum Seoul and Sydney 2019. My journey started in San Francisco on Friday evening, December 6th, 2019, on a flight to Seoul.&#xA;I arrived in Seoul on Sunday, December 8th, in the morning and had plenty of time during the day to rest in the hotel at the venue, The Seoul Dragon City. As speakers, we were invited along with the organizers and community leaders to an event dinner in the Goguryeo room.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes has come a long way over the last 2 years and I was so excited to learn about during CloudNativeCon/Kubecon Berlin this year.&#xA;As of Today Kops the standard tool for installing Kubernetes on AWS doesn&amp;rsquo;t support GCP yet (it&amp;rsquo;s in the works). However you can still setup your cluster using good old kube-up.sh. There&amp;rsquo;s also a pretty good explanation on the k8s docs. Make sure you install the Google Cloud SDK with gcloud and all their utils.</description>
