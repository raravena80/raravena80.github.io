      <description>From Ideas to Impact: Cloud Native AI and TOC Highlights Post-KubeCon EU 2025 When we previewed the CNCF Cloud Native AI Working Group&amp;rsquo;s efforts ahead of KubeCon EU 2025, the tone was of curiosity and anticipation. Some still viewed AI as an outlier in the cloud-native world. But if KubeCon EU proved anything, AI has now fully arrived—and the community is building it in a cloud native way.&#xA;This year&amp;rsquo;s event didn&amp;rsquo;t just validate the momentum around AI; it showcased a CNCF community that&amp;rsquo;s actively rethinking its foundations—from how Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs) work to how the community serves end users to how projects grow and graduate.</description>

      <description>Over the past six months, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation&amp;rsquo;s (CNCF) Cloud Native AI (CNAI) Working Group has been at the forefront of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with cloud-native technologies. This is a moment to discuss the working group&amp;rsquo;s initiatives and opportunities for contributors and enthusiasts as we prepare for KubeCon Europe 2025 in London.&#xA;The group has been making strides in galvanizing the community around the needs of AI/ML workloads on top of cloud native environments.</description>
