      <description>The Kata community has been busy getting the first release out the door.
Virtual Machines have been around in the industry for over 20 years. One of the most attractive features of Kata is that it runs containers in VMs and VMs are very stable and provide very good isolation of your compute resources hardware. Furthermore, virtualization systems like KVM, Xen and VMware provide multiple ways to attach to dedicated storage.</description>

      <title>The Boom of Container Runtimes</title>

      <description>It has been about 4 years since Docker exploded into the scene of Cloud Infrastructure. With that came a shift in cloud applications from monolithic to microservices. Containers made it easy for developers to deploy directly to production mostly caring about the scope of her/his microservice.
Enter container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes, Mesos, AWS ECS, GKE, Azure Container Service which allow cloud operations to manage containers at scale. Setup these tools with a redundant masters as quorum systems (k8s, mesos) and add hundreds of nodes or slaves and automatically scale your containers up and down depending on demand.</description>

      <description>It has been about 4 months since I started working at Branch and wanted to reflect on what it&amp;rsquo;s been like.
I can truly say that I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying everything about it. The environment is fantastic, my co-workers are awesome, and we all come from various backgrounds.
I like the fact that the company takes their values seriously and the founding team is focused on making working at Branch the best experience you&amp;rsquo;ve ever had in your career.</description>

      <title>Kubernetes on GCP</title>

      <description>Kubernetes has come a long way over the last 2 years and I was so excited to learn about during CloudNativeCon/Kubecon Berlin this year.
As of Today Kops the standard tool for installing Kubernetes on AWS doesn&amp;rsquo;t support GCP yet (it&amp;rsquo;s in the works). However you can still setup your cluster using good old kube-up.sh. There&amp;rsquo;s also a pretty good explanation on the k8s docs. Make sure you install the Google Cloud SDK with gcloud and all their utils.</description>

      <title>DC/OS on GCP</title>

      <description>DC/OS is the commercialized Mesos distribution + extras maintained by Mesosphere. I found it very straight forward to setup in GCP with the out of the box Ansible scripts provided by Mesosphere.
For starters I followed everything described in the README.
Then, I had to modify the group_vars/all file in the playbook
--- project: &amp;lt;my-gcp-project-id&amp;gt; subnet: default login_name: &amp;lt;my-gcp-login-id-with-no-email&amp;gt; bootstrap_public_ip: 10.128.0.10 # This IP need to match the network in the zone zone: us-central1-c master_boot_disk_size: 200 # 200 is the recommended in GCP as of 05-2017 master_machine_type: n1-standard-1 master_boot_disk_type: pd-standard agent_boot_disk_size: 200 agent_machine_type: n1-standard-1 agent_boot_disk_type: pd-standard agent_instance_type: &amp;quot;MIGRATE&amp;quot; agent_type: private start_id: 0001 end_id: 0001 gcloudbin: gcloud image: &#39;centos-7-v20161027&#39; image_project: &#39;centos-cloud&#39; bootstrap_public_port: 8080 cluster_name: cluster_name scopes: &amp;quot;default=https://www.</description>

      <title>Parsing Deeply Nested JSON in Go</title>
      <link>https://blog.serverbooter.com/post/parsing-nested-json-in-go/</link>

      <description>Parsing deeply nested json in Go is a bit challenging due to the fact that the language doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide many helpers to do so. If you do that in Ruby or Python it&amp;rsquo;s pretty straight forward running some like this in Python j = json.load(jsonstring) or in Ruby j = JSON.load(jsonstring).
In go generally you have to prefine your structs and run through an Unmarshal function which means that most of the times you need to know ahead of time what the nest level and structure of your target json is to parse it.</description>

      <description>This same blog entry is here. Thanks to the cncf folks who helped me put this together.
Iâ€™ve attended many conferences before, but I was happy to get the diversity scholarship to attend CloudNativeCon + KubeCon Europe 2017 in Berlin as there is always so much more to learn. It was my first time attending an event organized by the Linux Foundation, and I hope to attend more in the future.</description>

      <description>Over the last couple of years Docker has seen incredible growth across the tech industry. Its use ties together with deployment of Microservices in most Cloud based companies. Docker is easy to use and its in constant development. In the last month I decided to venture and try something different that has been around even before Docker but in a more primitive form. You see containers have been around before Docker for a long time and even before that with the introduction of chroot in 1979.</description>

      <description>For the last few days I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking at crack at using the recent Docker container deployment tool that I&amp;rsquo;ve been hearing a lot buzz about. In essence, it&amp;rsquo;s a wrapper on top of Linux LXC containers, writen in the new friendly and not so popular yet Go language developed at Google.
Just a little bit of background, for those of you not familiar with LXC containers, they are pretty much defined as chroot on steroids.</description>

      <description>This posts describes how to create a simple Ansible task on how to setup PaperTrail on Ubuntu.
It&amp;rsquo;s a follow up to a previous blog describing an Ansible Playbook to setup an HAProxy system. This Ansible task can be included in the HAProxy playbook as well as any other playbooks with something like this:
--- PLAYBOOK: Install papertrail on Ubuntu --- - name: scout hosts: all user: &amp;lt;user-with-sudo&amp;gt; sudo: True tasks: - include: tasks/papertrail.</description>

      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll describe how to create a simple AWS CloudFormation template so that we can deploy stack using multiple AWS accounts. In other words a common JSON CloudFormation template that can be use to bring up a stack in multiple accounts. The way we are able to do this is by having exact copies of the EC2 AMIs on all the accounts and regions where we are deploying our stack.</description>

      <description>This is the continuation for Setup a simple HAproxy config
It explains how to create an Ansible playbook to automate the haproxy configuration.
If you&amp;rsquo;d like to find out more about Ansible you can read up on it on their website: http://www.ansible.com
--- # Set up and configure an HaProxy server (Ubuntu flavor) - name: haproxy hosts: all user: userwithsudoaccess sudo: True tags: haproxy vars_files: - &amp;quot;vars/main.yml&amp;quot; tasks: # haproxy package for Ubuntu - include: tasks/haproxy-apt.</description>
