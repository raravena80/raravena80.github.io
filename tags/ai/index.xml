&lt;p>When &lt;a href="https://www.serverbooter.com/post/cncf-cloud-native-ai-working-group-innovation-from-edge-to-core/">we previewed&lt;/a> the CNCF Cloud Native AI Working Group&amp;rsquo;s efforts ahead of KubeCon EU 2025, the tone was of curiosity and anticipation. Some still viewed AI as an outlier in the cloud-native world. But if KubeCon EU proved anything, AI has now fully arrived—and the community is building it &lt;em>in a cloud native way&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This year&amp;rsquo;s event didn&amp;rsquo;t just validate the momentum around AI; it showcased a CNCF community that&amp;rsquo;s actively rethinking its foundations—from how Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs) work to how the community serves end users to how projects grow and graduate. The CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) had a visible and influential role throughout the week, laying down a clear marker: the next wave of cloud native isn&amp;rsquo;t just about orchestration—it&amp;rsquo;s about intelligence, usability, and sustainable growth.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CNCF Cloud Native AI Working Group: Innovation from Edge to Core!</title><link>http://localhost:1313/post/cncf-cloud-native-ai-working-group-innovation-from-edge-to-core/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 14:17:00 +0000</pubDate><author>raravena80@gmail.com (Ricardo Aravena)</author><guid>http://localhost:1313/post/cncf-cloud-native-ai-working-group-innovation-from-edge-to-core/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the past six months, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation&amp;rsquo;s (CNCF) &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tS6gL5qjGLaHDtAChssqJhBVm8BIpopUA3Ddzm9LHwg/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.tprh9feizr4r">Cloud Native AI (CNAI) Working Group&lt;/a> has been at the forefront of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with cloud-native technologies. This is a moment to discuss the working group&amp;rsquo;s initiatives and opportunities for contributors and enthusiasts as we prepare for KubeCon Europe 2025 in London.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The group has been making strides in galvanizing the community around the needs of AI/ML workloads on top of cloud native environments. A significant deliverable was the publication of the &amp;ldquo;Cloud Native AI&amp;rdquo; whitepaper in March 2024.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
