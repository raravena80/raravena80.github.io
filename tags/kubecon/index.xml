      <description>&lt;p&gt;This same blog entry is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cncf.io/blog/2017/04/18/diversity-scholarship-series-berlin-eyes-cloud-infrastructure-fanatic/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to the cncf folks who helped me put this together.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve attended many conferences before, but I was happy to get the diversity scholarship to attend CloudNativeCon + KubeCon Europe 2017 in Berlin as there is always so much more to learn. It was my first time attending an event organized by the Linux Foundation, and I hope to attend more in the future.&#xA;I loved all the insights and advances that I obtained through all of the highlighted Cloud Native projects including Kubernetes, gRPC, OpenTracing, Prometheus, Linkerd, Fluentd and OpenDNS from the variety of industry leaders.  The keynotes were quite memorable as well, including the Kubernetes 1.6 updates by Aparna Sinha (Google), Federation from Kelsey Hightower (Google), Kubernetes Security Updates from Clayton Coleman (Red Hat), Helm from Michelle Noorali (Deis), Scaling Kubernetes from Joe Beda (Heptio) and Quay from Brandon Phillips (CoreOS).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
