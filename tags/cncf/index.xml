&lt;p>Virtual Machines have been around in the industry for over 20 years. One of the most attractive features of Kata is that it runs containers in VMs and VMs are very stable and provide very good isolation of your compute resources hardware. Furthermore, virtualization systems like KVM, Xen and VMware provide multiple ways to attach to dedicated storage. VMware takes this step even further by providing things like Storage VMotion.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Boom of Container Runtimes</title><link>https://serverbooter.com/post/container-runtimes-cncf/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Mar 2018 14:17:00 +0000</pubDate><author>raravena80@gmail.com (Ricardo Aravena)</author><guid>https://serverbooter.com/post/container-runtimes-cncf/</guid><description>&lt;p>It has been about 4 years since Docker exploded into the scene of Cloud Infrastructure.
With that came a shift in cloud applications from monolithic to microservices. Containers
made it easy for developers to deploy directly to production mostly caring about the scope of
her/his microservice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enter container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes, Mesos, AWS ECS, GKE, Azure Container Service which
allow cloud operations to manage containers at scale. Setup these tools with a redundant masters as
quorum systems (k8s, mesos) and add hundreds of nodes or slaves and automatically scale your
containers up and down depending on demand.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CloudNativeCon KubeCon Europe</title><link>https://serverbooter.com/post/cloudnativecon-kubecon-europe/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2017 16:28:29 +0000</pubDate><author>raravena80@gmail.com (Ricardo Aravena)</author><guid>https://serverbooter.com/post/cloudnativecon-kubecon-europe/</guid><description>&lt;p>This same blog entry is &lt;a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2017/04/18/diversity-scholarship-series-berlin-eyes-cloud-infrastructure-fanatic/">here&lt;/a>. Thanks to the cncf folks who helped me put this together.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Iâ€™ve attended many conferences before, but I was happy to get the diversity scholarship to attend CloudNativeCon + KubeCon Europe 2017 in Berlin as there is always so much more to learn. It was my first time attending an event organized by the Linux Foundation, and I hope to attend more in the future.
I loved all the insights and advances that I obtained through all of the highlighted Cloud Native projects including Kubernetes, gRPC, OpenTracing, Prometheus, Linkerd, Fluentd and OpenDNS from the variety of industry leaders. The keynotes were quite memorable as well, including the Kubernetes 1.6 updates by Aparna Sinha (Google), Federation from Kelsey Hightower (Google), Kubernetes Security Updates from Clayton Coleman (Red Hat), Helm from Michelle Noorali (Deis), Scaling Kubernetes from Joe Beda (Heptio) and Quay from Brandon Phillips (CoreOS).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
