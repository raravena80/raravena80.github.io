      <description>Following up on Part 1 for my previous blog and recommendations from Archana Shinde and Graham Whaley. I made a few tweaks to the /usr/share/defaults/kata-containers/configuration.toml configs.
The machine specs are the same:
 C2S bare metal machine from ScaleWay 4 Dedicated x86 64bit Cores 8GB Memory 50GB SSD Disk  These are the changes in the configs (from the default)
default_vcpus = 4 default_memory = 3072 enable_iothreads = true  I also changed the number of operations from 2500000 to 500000 and first I ran the tests using the devicemapper configs in Docker with an external /var/lib/scylla volume.</description>

      <description>The Kata community has been busy getting the first release out the door.
Virtual Machines have been around in the industry for over 20 years. One of the most attractive features of Kata is that it runs containers in VMs and VMs are very stable and provide very good isolation of your compute resources hardware. Furthermore, virtualization systems like KVM, Xen and VMware provide multiple ways to attach to dedicated storage.</description>
